# Sitemap Generator

Let's say you want to create a specific sitemap with just some urls. For example:
Instead of creating a sitemap with all the pages via Screaming Frog or Yoast, you can:

> Download this folder and upload on your website root
> Insert all the pages you want in the pages.txt
> Enter on the url your-site.com/sitemap-generator/sitemap-generator.php
> The Sitemap will be automatically there.
